# Object-Oriented Programming in Kotlin

This repository contains a Kotlin file named `OOP_Kotlin.kt`, showcasing an example of an educational platform application implemented using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Kotlin. The file consists of classes representing users, educational content, and formations.

## Features

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have the Kotlin development environment set up.
2. Run the code from the `OOP_Kotlin.kt` file in a Kotlin-compatible environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, VSCode with Kotlin plugin, or via command line using the Kotlin compiler).
